# ML-project-classifiers-Diabetic-dataset.-
project Machine Learning classifiers on the provided Diabetic dataset using  scikit-learn to implement Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor
## About Project
In this Project I learned how to apply the logistic regression model 
and the KNN model, applying the different feature selection methods like 
the filter selection and wrapper methods, applying the principle 
component analysis, and applying SOM algorithm and DBSCAN algorithm.
